# Corporate Stress Dataset
### Project Motivations:
##### (Why we decide to work on this problem?)
We chose this dataset because workplace stress is a big problem that affects both employees and companies. High stress can lead to burnout, low job satisfaction, and people leaving their jobs. This dataset has helpful information like stress levels  (measured on a scale from 0 to 10), working hours, work-life balance, and job roles, which makes it good for studying workplace stress.
In this project, we will find the main causes of stress and see how it changes based on things like working hours, job roles, and work-life balance. The results can help companies make workplaces better, reduce stress, and improve employee happiness andÂ productivity.
