        "#### In today’s fast-paced corporate world, workplace stress has become a growing concern. High stress levels negatively impact employee performance, health, and overall company productivity. Many organizations struggle to identify and mitigate stress due to the lack of proper data-driven analysis.\n",

        "#### This project aims to analyze and predict employee stress levels based on various personal, professional, and lifestyle attributes. By doing so, companies can take informed actions to improve employee well-being and create healthier work environments.\n"

        "- **Class Attribute:** Stress_Level\n",
        "- **Goal:** To predict the employee’s level of stress (Low, Moderate, or High) based on various features such as job role, salary, working hours, and lifestyle factors.\n",
        "- **Purpose:** This task enables organizations to proactively identify employees who are at risk of high stress levels, allowing timely support and intervention.\n",

        "#### Clustering\n",

        "- **Goal:** To group employees into distinct clusters based on shared characteristics that contribute to stress, without using the stress label (Stress_Level).\n",
        "- **Purpose:** This task helps uncover hidden patterns or stress profiles in the workforce, which can inform more personalized wellness and HR strategies."

Decision trees were chosen due to their interpretability, ease of visualization, and suitability for both numerical and categorical data. Additionally, they are effective for datasets where the relationship between features and class labels can be captured using a set of decision rules.\n",
