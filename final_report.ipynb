High stress levels negatively impact employee performance, health, and overall company productivity. Many organizations struggle to identify and mitigate stress due to the lack of proper data-driven analysis.\n",

        "- **Goal:** To group employees into distinct clusters based on shared characteristics that contribute to stress, without using the stress label (Stress_Level).\n",
        "- **Purpose:** This task helps uncover hidden patterns or stress profiles in the workforce, which can inform more personalized wellness and HR strategies."
