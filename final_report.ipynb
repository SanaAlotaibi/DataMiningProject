    "In today\u2019s fast-paced corporate world, workplace stress has become a growing concern. High stress levels negatively impact employee performance, health, and overall company productivity. Many organizations struggle to identify and mitigate stress due to the lack of proper data-driven analysis.",

    "- **Goal**: Predict the employee\u2019s **Stress_Level** (Low, Moderate, High).",
    "- **Class Attribute**: `Stress_Level`",
    "- **Type**: Supervised learning",
    "- **Use Case**: This allows HR departments to proactively identify at-risk employees based on labeled past data.",

    "",
    "- **Goal**: Group employees into clusters based on shared attributes related to stress without knowing their stress label.",
